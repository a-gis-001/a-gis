## Upload to PyPI

### Register on PyPI and get token

Register an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), go to [Account settings § API tokens](https://pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens), "Add API token". The PyPI token only appears once, copy it somewhere. If you missed it, delete the old and add a new token.

(Register a [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) account if you are uploading to TestPyPI)

### Set secret in GitHub repo

On the page of your newly created or existing GitHub repo, click **Settings** -> **Secrets** -> **New repository secret**, the **Name** should be `PYPI_API_TOKEN` and the **Value** should be your PyPI token (which starts with `pypi-`).

### Push or release

The example package has automated tests and upload (publishing) already set up with GitHub Actions:

- Every time you `git push` or a pull request is submitted on your `master` or `main` branch, the package is automatically tested against the desired Python versions with GitHub Actions.
- Every time a new release (either the initial version or an updated version) is created, the latest version of the package is automatically uploaded to PyPI with GitHub Actions.

### View it on pypi.org

After your package is published on PyPI, go to [https://pypi.org/project/example-pypi-package/](https://pypi.org/project/example-pypi-package/) (`_` becomes `-`). Copy the command on the page, execute it to download and install your package from PyPI. (or test.pypi.org if you use that)

If you want to modify the description / README of your package on pypi.org, you have to publish a new version.

### Install Twine

Install or upgrade Twine:

```bash
python -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
```

Create a **.pypirc** file in your **$HOME** (**~**) directory, its content should be:

```ini
[pypi]
username = __token__
password = <PyPI token>
```

(Use `[testpypi]` instead of `[pypi]` if you are uploading to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/))

Replace `<PyPI token>` with your real PyPI token (which starts with `pypi-`).

(if you don't manually create **$HOME/.pypirc**, you will be prompted for a username (which should be `__token__`) and password (which should be your PyPI token) when you run Twine)

### Upload

Run Twine to upload all of the archives under **dist** folder:

```bash
python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```

(use `testpypi` instead of `pypi` if you are uploading to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/))

### Update

When you finished developing a newer version of your package, do the following things.

Modify the version number `__version__` in **src\a_gis\_\_init\_\_.py**.

Delete all old versions in **dist**.

Run the following command again to regenerate **dist**:

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

Run the following command again to upload **dist**:

```bash
python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```

(use `testpypi` instead of `pypi` if needed)
