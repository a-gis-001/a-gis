<p>(a) Standard—24 fuel and seven heat pipes (b) Control—18 fuel and six heat pipes</p>
<p>Figure 1: Fuel assemblies for the gHPMR.</p>
<p>The specifications for the heat pipe are in Table 3, which are adopted from the Argonne National Laboratory report [2]. The “evaporator length” here includes not just the 1.6 m active core
length (length of fuel pins) but also the 0.2 m reflector section that is coupled to the heat pipe.</p>
