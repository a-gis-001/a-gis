      "The basic sequence is\n",
      "\n",
      "1. raw function only (8 lines or less ideally) \n",
      "2. add comments and spacing\n",
      "3. add docstring\n",

      "work on making that beautiful. \n",
      "\n",
      "It could get examples, and all kinds of crazy awesome reformatting\n",
      "as its own document. Then we can reapply comments to the raw source,\n",
      "THEN the docstring, then format. We could send this to an AI now to\n",

      "\n",
      "You should be able to apply this approach hierarchically to handle tests\n",

      "Finally, it should be possible to hash the raw function content like\n",
      "IPFS and provide these in a distributed computing framework, where you\n",
      "basically call a function by the hash, `output = A_GIS.<hash>(input)`\n",
      "which ensures you get a specific version of that function even across\n",
