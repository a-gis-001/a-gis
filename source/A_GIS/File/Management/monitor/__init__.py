    """Monitor a directory for changes.

    This function initializes and starts a watcher that monitors a specified
    directory tree for any changes, including file creations and deletions.
    It uses an observer from the `watchdog` library and a custom event
    handler to process events and update a MongoDB collection with the
    changes detected.

    The monitor function is designed to run indefinitely until interrupted.
    It continuously checks the monitored directory tree for changes at
    intervals specified by `sleep_seconds`. When a change is detected, it
    processes the event using the provided `should_ignore` callback to
    determine if the event should be recorded or ignored. If the event is
    not ignored, it is added to the MongoDB collection specified by
    `collection`.

    Args:
        root_dir (pathlib.Path):
            The root directory to monitor. This is the starting point for the
            directory tree that will be watched.
        collection (pymongo.collection.Collection):
            The MongoDB collection where monitored file changes will be stored.
        should_ignore (callable[[str], bool]):
            A function that determines whether a change should be ignored or not. It
            receives a file path string and returns True if the path should be
            ignored, or False otherwise.
        logger (logging.Logger, optional):
            The logger to use for logging messages. If None, no logging will be
            performed.
        sleep_seconds (float, optional):
            The number of seconds to wait between checks for changes in the
            monitored directory tree.
        max_entries (int, optional):
            The maximum number of entries to store in the event handler's queue
            before older events are discarded.

    Returns:
        None:
            The function does not return any value. It continuously monitors the
            directory tree until interrupted by a KeyboardInterrupt or until the
            observer stops due to an exception.
