    """Monitor a directory tree for changes and records new or modified files into a MongoDB collection using the `watchdog` library.

    This function initializes and starts a watcher that monitors a specified directory tree for any changes, including file creations and deletions. It uses an observer from the `watchdog` library and a custom event handler to process events and update a MongoDB collection with the changes detected.

    Args:
        root_dir (pathlib.Path):
            The root directory to monitor. This is the starting point for the directory tree that will be watched.
        collection (pymongo.collection.Collection):
            The MongoDB collection where monitored file changes will be stored.
        should_ignore (callable):
            A function that determines whether a change should be ignored or not. It receives a file path string
            and returns True if the path should be ignored, or False otherwise.
        logger (logging.Logger, optional):
            The logger to use for logging messages. If None, no logging will be performed.
        sleep_seconds (float, optional):
            The number of seconds to wait between checks for changes in the monitored directory tree.
        max_entries (int, optional):
            The maximum number of entries to store in the event handler's queue before older events are discarded.

    Returns:
        None:
            The function does not return any value. It continuously monitors the directory tree until interrupted by a KeyboardInterrupt or until the observer stops due to an exception.

    Raises:
        KeyboardInterrupt:
            Stops the observer and ends the monitoring loop if a keyboard interrupt is detected.
