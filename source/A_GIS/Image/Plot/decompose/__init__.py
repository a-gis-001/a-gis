def decompose(*, image: "A_GIS.Image._Image") -> "decompose._Plot":
    """
    Decompose a plot into its basic components, including axes and their attributes.

    Args:
        image (A_GIS.Image._Image): An instance of A_GIS.Image._Image, which represents the image
            associated with plot components.

    This function dynamically defines data classes for various components of a plot such as text,
    lines, and axes, creating a structured representation of a plot. These data classes are
    nested within the function to encapsulate their use and minimize external exposure.

    Returns:
        decompose._Plot: A data structure representing a plot with its axes components.
