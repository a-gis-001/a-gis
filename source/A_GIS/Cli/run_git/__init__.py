def run_git(*, mode: str = "status", args: list[str]):
    """Execute a Git command and return its styled output as a panel.

    This function runs a Git command specified by the `mode` argument
    and any additional arguments (`args`) passed to it. It ensures that
    the Git command uses a consistent UI color setting before executing,
    which can be overridden if necessary. The function captures the
    command's output and formats it using the `rich` library for
    styling.

    The command is constructed with the 'git' executable followed by
    options and arguments. It then runs the command as a subprocess,
    capturing its standard output. The output is processed to remove
    trailing spaces from each line and replace tabs with five spaces for
    better readability.

    After processing the output, the function creates a
    `rich.panel.Panel` object that contains the styled output. This
    panel is titled according to the Git command executed (e.g., "git
    status args..."). The panel can be displayed in an application using
    the `rich` library and supports expansion to fill its container,
    with a custom border style.

    Args:
        mode (str):
            The Git command to run (e.g., "status", "commit", etc.).
        args (list[str]):
            A list of additional arguments to pass to the Git command.

    Returns:
        rich.panel.Panel:
            A styled output panel containing the Git command's result.
            The panel includes the command's output with enhanced text
            styling, a title indicating the command executed, and can be
            displayed within a `rich` environment.
