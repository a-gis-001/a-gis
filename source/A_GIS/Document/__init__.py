"""Operate on documents.

Documents are vehicles to deliver information to a specific audience.

Documents are more than just text or specific file formats.

Documents contain data. Data is independent from representation.
But a document includes specific representations of data to help the intended
audience most easily absorb it. Documents have a purpose.

This module explores the following.

- Can we classify documents?
- Can a document be converted back to data?
- Can we identify components of a document and extract them?
