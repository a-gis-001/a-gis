def get_patch(*, initial: str, final: str):
    """Compute the diff patches between two strings.

    This function computes the differences between two strings
    (`initial` and `final`) using the Diff-Match-Patch library. It uses
    the `patch_make` method of an instance of
    `diff_match_patch.diff_match_patch` to generate the set of
    operations (patches) that transform the `initial` string into the
    `final` string. The function then converts these patches into a
    human-readable text format using the `patch_toText` method of the
    same instance and returns this as a string.

    Args:
        initial (str):
            The original text or code from which changes will be
            computed.
        final (str):
            The modified text or code that contains the changes relative
            to `initial`.

    Returns:
        str:
            A string containing the diff patches in a human-readable
            format.
