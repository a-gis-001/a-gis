def check(*, blocks: list[list[str]]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Checks a list of code blocks to ensure they meet specific requirements regarding import statements and comment usage.

    The function validates that:
    - The first code block may optionally contain absolute imports.
    - All subsequent code blocks must start with one or more comment lines, followed by code, and optionally end with a blank line.

    Args:
        blocks: A list of code blocks, where each block is a list of strings, with each string representing a line of code.

    Returns:
        A list of strings, where each string is a message detailing any violations found within the code blocks.
