def replace_from_imports(*, code: str) -> str:
    """Replaces 'from' import statements with absolute imports in a given Python code string.

    This function takes a Python code as input and searches for 'from' import statements.
    It then replaces these 'from' import statements with equivalent absolute import statements,
    where each imported item is individually imported from the respective module.

    Args:
        code (str): The Python code string to be processed.

    Returns:
        str: The modified Python code string with 'from' imports replaced by absolute imports.

    Raises:
        None

    Notes:
        - This function uses regular expressions for pattern matching and replacement.
          It matches the pattern of a 'from' import statement, groups the module name and
          the imported items, then replaces each match with equivalent absolute imports.
        - The returned code string contains multiple individual import statements for each
          item from an original 'from' import statement in the input code.
        - This function does not handle cases where there are aliases or specific items being
          imported from a module, as these complexities would require a more sophisticated
          approach with additional regular expression matching and replacement.
