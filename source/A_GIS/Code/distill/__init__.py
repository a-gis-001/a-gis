def distill(*, code: str) -> str:
    """Distill the given Python code by removing docstrings, converting
    multiline string literals, and removing comments.

    This function parses the provided Python code into an abstract syntax tree (AST),
    and then walks through the AST. It identifies and blanks out all docstrings and
    multiline string literals. Additionally, due to the nature of AST parsing in Python,
    comments (which start with '#') are not included in the AST and hence are not present
    in the unparsed code, effectively removing them from the output.

    It's important to note that this removal of comments is a byproduct of how the Python
    parser and the AST handle comments, rather than an explicit action by this function.

    Args:
        code (str): A string representing the Python code to be distilled.

    Returns:
        str: A string representing the purified Python code, with docstrings, multiline string
             literals, and comments removed.

    Examples:
        >>> ds=('"'*3) + 'I am a docstring!' + ('"'*3)
        >>> test_code = f'''
        ... def example_function(param1, param2):
        ...     {ds}
        ...     # This is a comment.
        ...     return (param1, param2)
        ... '''
        >>> print(distill(code=test_code))
        def example_function(param1, param2):
            return (param1, param2)
