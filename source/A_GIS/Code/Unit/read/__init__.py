def read(*, name: str):
    """Read a file associated with a code unit.

    This function performs the following steps:

    1. It uses the `to_path` function to determine the full path to the
       file associated with the given unit name (`name`). The path is
       resolved relative to a root directory found by the
       `A_GIS.Code.find_root` function.
    2. If the path exists, it reads the content of the file located at
       that path. The reading mode is determined by the `binary` flag:
       text mode if `False`, binary mode if `True`.
    3. It creates and returns an instance of a dataclass named 'Result'
       with attributes 'path', 'code', and 'name', initialized with the
       respective values obtained from the file content and the input
       parameters.

    Args:
        name (str): The identifier for the code unit whose associated file content is to be
            read. For example, this file has unit name='A_GIS.Code.Unit.read'.

    Returns:
        Result: A dataclass with the following attributes:
            - path: The path to the file that was read
            - code: The content of the file as a string or bytes object,
              depending on the `binary` argument used during reading
            - name: The name of the code unit associated with the file
