def is_path(*, name: str):
    """Is the name likely to represent a path

    This function checks if the provided `name` string could represent an
    existing file system path, a Python source code file, or both by
    checking for specific conditions such as the existence of the path,
    presence of a path separator in the name, and whether it ends with ".py".

    Args:
        name (str): The name or path to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if `name` could represent an existing file system path
        or Python source code file; False otherwise.
