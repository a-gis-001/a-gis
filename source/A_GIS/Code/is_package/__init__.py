def is_package(*, code: str, filename: str = ""):
    """Checks whether the provided code is a package or not.

    This function checks if the file is named "__init__.py", which indicates
    it's a package. If not, it distills the code to remove comments and other
    non-import statements, then checks if all lines start with "from". If they do,
    the function returns True, indicating that the code primarily consists of
    import statements and thus likely represents a package.

    Args:
        code (str): The code to be checked for being a package.
        filename (str, optional): The name of the file containing the code.
        This is used to check if the file is named "__init__.py".
        Defaults to an empty string.

    Raises:
        None

    Returns:
        bool: True if the provided code likely represents a package
        (either because it's in a file named "__init__.py" or because
        all lines start with "from"), False otherwise.
